## Task 2: Paper designs and assets
In this task, you will undertake Session 4 which will introduce you to the concept of a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** in a series of paper-based designed screens. You will then refine your app design ideas and begin to research graphics and sound to use in your app.

Now develop your designs for your app on the mobile screen templates on page 4 and 5 of the [Student Worksheets](http://ncce.io/Qmo6oA){:target="_blank"}.

Think about essential and feasible features, sketching out how you want your screens to look. Consider what the user sees when they open the app, and how they move through screens and use important features.

You will now go on to Part 3 of the online course, developing your knowledge of AppLab. Learning about AppLab will help you refine your app ideas further, identify how you can program your app, see your ideas in a working app and share your app with others.
