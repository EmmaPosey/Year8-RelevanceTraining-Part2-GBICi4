In this task you will undertake session 3(https://ncce.io/jQMOvR) to help to build on your existing teaching skills in app design and idea development. Exploring this session in detail will give you the opportunity to develop a working understanding of the correlation between the various resource files as well as experience a lesson from the pupils' perspective. You will be using the ideas you develop in session 3 towards a working app which you will program in Part 3 of this course. Keep a record of your ideas using the Student Worksheets provided.
