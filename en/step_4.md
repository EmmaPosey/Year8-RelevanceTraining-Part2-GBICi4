Now work through [Session 3](https://ncce.io/jQMOvR){:target="_blank"}, which will help to build on your existing teaching skills in app design and idea development. Exploring the resources in detail will improve your understanding of how the different files work together in the session. It will also allow you to experience the lesson from a pupilâ€™s perspective.

You will be using the ideas you develop in Session 3 towards a working app which you will program in Part 3 of this course. Keep a record of your ideas using the Student Worksheets  (or Student Workbook) provided.
