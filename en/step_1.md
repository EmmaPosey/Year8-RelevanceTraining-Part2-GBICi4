## Part 2: Year 8 Relevance Training - Getting started
Part 2 introduces you to accessing the online Relevance intervention resources. Then, through three tasks you will focus on the development of ideas on apps that address real-world issues and complete sessions that the pupils themselves undertake. Over the course of Part 2 and Part 3 you will have an opportunity to explore all the resources for yourself, try them out and think about how to implement the sessions in your own classroom.

## Accessing the Relevance resources
In this session, you are going to access the session resources you will need for the Relevance trial. 

The session introduces you to the [Relevance Resource portal](NEED LINK - HAYLEY WHAT URL) where you can explore all the resources for Session 1 to 12. The webpage is the access portal for all the resources relating to the Relevance trial. Here you can follow links to Google Docs and Google Slides.

Links to all of the resources can also be found in your [Project Guide](LINK NEEDED) and also accessed via the [Google Drive](https://ncce.io/KNDNJR).

The resources consist of one Session sub-folder (with the 12 sessions) and four documents. Feel free to download the resources or access them each time you need them from this webpage. You may wish to bookmark the link to the resources in the browser toolbar of the teacherâ€™s tablet/iPad/computer for ease of reference.
