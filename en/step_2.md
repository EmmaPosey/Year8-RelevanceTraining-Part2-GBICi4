## Twelve sessions
Sessions 1 to 5 gradually introduce learners to the process of developing ideas for apps that can address a real-world problem. From Session 6, students are introduced to the App Lab environment and related blocks that can be used to construct their app. Over the course of these subsequent sessions, students explore the programming concepts of sequencing, selection, and repetition to produce an app of their choice.
